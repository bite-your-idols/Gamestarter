WIP      LaunchBox Games Database scraper.
         Apparently LaunchBox GamesDB started as a copy of TheGamesDB. Currently there is no
         API to access LaunchBox GamesDB but an XML with all the database info can be downloaded.

         See http://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/
         See https://bitbucket.org/jasondavidcarr/launchbox/issues/902/api-access-to-launchbox

WIP      Have a look at https://www.screenscraper.fr/ and consider it for an online scraper.

WIP      Add an option to see the ROM Manual in PDF if exists. Maybe use GhostScript to render
         the PDF into images like HyperLauncher does?
         Add an option in context menu "View ROM/Launcher".

WIP      Add an option to create a default Parent ROM for Redump DATs or NoIntro DATs with no
         PClone information. See previous feature.

WIP      Create a "fake" Parent/Clone list from filenames ala NARS (NARS Advanced ROM Sorting).
         In "Edit Launcher", "Audit ROMs / Launcher view mode" include a new option like
         "Create PClone DAT based on ROM filenames"

WIP      Options to generate the 1G1R parent list, like prefer ROMs from Europe, Japan or USA.
         This resembles what NARS No-Intro filtering does.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.7-beta1 | 07 October 2017[/B]

FEATURE  Added a lot of new platforms.

FEATURE  Add an option to see ROM Maps image if it exists.
         Add an option in context menu "View ROM/Launcher".

FEATURE  Audit all launchers. Check if app exists, ROM path exits, artwork paths are configured,
         etc. When a user uses XML to import configurations it is easy to make a typo when
         writing directory names, etc. This command will report if AEL configuration is OK.

FEATURE  Use substituted artwork from the Parent/Clone group.
         So far implemented only in "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROMs", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork"

FEATURE  I discovered that in the ROM Scanner most of the time is spend looking for artwork. Before,
         I though it was the Offline scraper the culprit. Instead of using FileName().exists()
         create a set with all files in the directory and use that for the search.
         Implemented only in "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROMs", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork",
         must be ported to the ROM scanner if it works well (faster than the current approach).

FEATURE  ROM scanner should be able to scrap all assets, not just the ones supported by the
         selected scraper. This will require a redesign of the current scraping engine.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2628383#pid2628383 and next post.

FEATURE  Make sure all asset scraper requests are cached in the ROM scanner. For example, Title
         scraper choose a game in the list, then Snap scraper for the same ROM must use the
         cached selected game.

FEATURE  Port to the ROM scanner the asset file cache. This will increase the scanning speed a lot.

FEATURE  ROMs in UNC paths. It seems Retroarch added UNC path support recently.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2647152#pid2647152

         [Windows]
         Workaround in _run_process() to add an extra '\\' character if argument starts with
         a '\\'. This is to fix shlex.split() behaviour.
         
         Tested in Windows only with the following configuration:
             <ROM_path>\\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\</ROM_path>
             <ROM_asset_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/</ROM_asset_path>

         This configuration also works in Windows:
             <ROM_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-ROMs/sega-genesis/</ROM_path>
             <ROM_asset_path>smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/</ROM_asset_path>

         Artwork is stored in JSON DB as "smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-assets/sega-genesis/boxbacks\\Sonic.jpg"
         ROMs are saved in JSON DB as "\\\\SERVER_NAME\\AEL-ROMs\\sega-genesis\\Sonic.md"

         Kodi artwork does not work with paths like \\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\image.png.
         Correct path for artwork is smb://SERVER_NAME/AEL-ROMs/sega-genesis/image.png.

         Retroarch requires a ROM path like \\SERVER_NAME\AEL-ROMs\sega-genesis\Sonic.md.

FEATURE  Launcher flag to enable non-blocking launchers. This is required for wrapper scripts
         that close Kodi to avoid problems (such as Kodi getting gamepad commands instead of the
         launcher app or Kodi running in standalone mode withouth a Window manager).

FEATURE  Ability to import launcher and categories assets in the XML configuration files.
         Create a working example for Gamestarter addon. Also, refactor the AEL asset library.

FEATURE  Rename "Studio" database field to "Developer" in Launchers/ROMs.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=295463&pid=2625754#pid2625754

FEATURE  New Launcher asset 's_controller' for Console/Computer controller picture.

FEATURE  Renamed 's_thumb' -> 's_icon' in Categories/Launchers/Collections.

FEATURE  Renamed 's_flyer' -> 's_poster' in Categories/Launchers/Collections.

FEATURE  Renamed 'roms_default_thumb' -> 'roms_default_icon' in Launchers.

FEATURE  Improved Retroplayer support.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=295463&pid=2620489#pid2620489
         and https://alwinesch.github.io/group__python__xbmcgui__listitem.html#ga0f1e91e1d5aa61d8dd0eac90e8edbf18

FEATURE  Audit Retroarch BIOSes in System directory.

FEATURE  Scan for artwork in the Parent/Clone group of a ROM. Implemented only in the context
         menu "Edit Launcher", "Manage ROM List", "Rescan ROMs local assets/artwork".

FEATURE  Support for <Launcher_NFO> tag in XML configuration files.

FEATURE  Preserve path_title, path_snap, etc. when exporting a Launcher into an XML file.

FEATURE  Add an option to suspend/resume joystick support at launch. This is to prevent Kodi
         and the launched app to grab joystick events.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2627128#pid2627128
         
         Cannot be implemented because setting input.enablejoystick does not exist in Krypton
         any more.

FEATURE  Removed ElementTree dependency in addon.xml. It's not longer needed.
         AEL ONLY WORKS ON KRYPTON NOW!!!

FEATURE  Use the <news> tag in addon.xml. In general, have a look at http://kodi.wiki/view/addon.xml
         and modernise addon.xml.

FEATURE  Update code to use new xbmcgui.Dialog().select() useDetails parameter. Get rid of the 
         ImgSelectDialog() class. This need Krypton Beta 4 to run!
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=250936&pid=2438074#pid2438074

FEATURE  Make use of Krypton features in the several dialogs of the addon: new param: "preselect" 
         for Dialog().multiselect() and Dialog().select(). 
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=250936&pid=2327011#pid2327011

FEATURE  Option to group Unknown ROMs as clones or keep them as parents. I realised it is not
         conveninent that the Unknown ROMs are clones in the Parent/Clone view.

FEATURE  1 Game 1 ROM launcher display mode. Copy it from AML.
         Changed launcher['pclone_launcher'] to launcher['launcher_display_mode'] to store the
         display mode in categories.xml database.

FEATURE  Addon option to hide [Browse Offline Scraper].

FEATURE  Remove duplicates from recent ROMs list. Contributed by bonzini.
         See https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher/pull/41

FEATURE  Preliminary render support for LaunchBox scraper.

FIX      Fixed launching of BAT files in Windows.

FIX      In order for skin shortcuts and widgets to work OK, addon concurrency must be enabled
         by database read-only commands.

FIX      Fix scraper-related crash in the ROM scanner.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2628382#pid2628382

FIX      When scraper downloads an image the parents JSON must be also updated. In general, every
         time a ROM is modified in the main database the Parents JSON must be updated to keep
         both DBs synchronised!

FIX      Fixed Unicode-related crashes introduced in 0.9.6 in the ROM scanner.
         See https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=276002&pid=2642201#pid2642201

         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2582004#pid2582004

FEATURE  Support Redump DAT files. Note that Redump does not include Parent/Clone data so all
         ROMs are Parent ROMs.

FEATURE  New platform Panasonic 3DO.

FEATURE  Update NFO files after scraping. This is useful to interrupt the scanner when scanning
         large collections and resume scanning later.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2548998#pid2548998

FEATURE  Allow only one instance of AEL running at a time.
         This prevents multiple launcher execution and also get rids forever of any database
         corruption issues due to concurrency! Thanks Roman_V_M for ideas about the fix.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=310697

FIX      Fixed crash when displaying a Launcher in Parent/Clone view with Unknown ROMs.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.6-beta1 | 5 March 2017[/B]

FEATURE  Import and Export of Launchers configurations. Will be very useful especially for 
         Android users.

FEATURE  Use a Window property to let skins know wheter a launcher OR ROMs are being rendered.
         Set xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'launchers')
             xbmcgui.Window(10001).setProperty('AEL_Content', 'roms')
         It must be set on entering and unset on exiting the plugin.

FEATURE  Use setProperty() to inform the skin about ROM flags:
           1) Favourite status: OK, Unlinked ROM, Unlinked Launcher, Broken
           2) No-Intro status: Have, Missing, Added, Unknown
           3) Parent/Clone status: Parent or Clone (Boolean)

         For example:
           setProperty('AEL_Fav_stat',     'Fav_OK')
           setProperty('AEL_NoIntro_stat', 'NoIntro_Have')
           setProperty('AEL_PClone_stat',  'PClone_Parent')

FEATURE  Add Retroplayer support.

         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2500040#pid2500040

FEATURE  Update launching mechanism. User Python subprocess module on all platforms and not the
         deprecated os.system(). Current patched subprocess_hack module is from Python 2.4. Current 
         Python version in Kodi is 2.7.
         os.system(), os.open(), etc. are deprecated, and the subprocess module should be used 
         instead for all platforms. A parser of arguments must be coded in order to use the 
         subprocess module.

FEATURE  Log emulator/standalone launcher stdout/stderr into a file. Requires new launching
         mechanism based on subprocess module. Have a look to AML for an implementation.

FEATURE  Add nplayers metadata field to ROMs. Billyc999 database has nplayers NFO.

         implementation.
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2495480#pid2495480

         AL ROM scanner only added the first disc to the database and skipped disc numbers
         from 2 to 9.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L2088

         At ROM launching, if any of the strings ['.cd1', '-cd1', '_cd1', ' cd1'] is found on the
         ROMfile basename then the rompath was scanned looking for all the discs. User selected
         the disc number to launch from a select dialog.
         https://github.com/Wintermute0110/plugin.program.advanced.launcher/blob/master/resources/lib/launcher_plugin.py#L1688

         AEL will use a better implementation based on a ROM filename parser. See NOTES.md

FEATURE  Delete ROM context menu integrated in Edit ROM.

FEATURE  Display number of ROMs in launcher.

FEATURE  Platform icons/clearlogos in AEL. Platform icons can be an icon of the console or gamepad.

FIX      ROM substitution keywords now use $ instead of the ugly %.
         %rom% becomes $rom$

FIX      Added new argument substitution keywords $rombasenoext$, $categoryID$, $launcherID$,
         and $romID$.

[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.5~beta1 | 13 December 2016[/B]

FEATURE  New Arcade Database online metadata/asset scraper for MAME ROMs.

FEATURE  Support for several arguments in launcher. This will be useful when using MAME for
         console emulation (MAME consoles from a different region have different names, and an
         European console will typically refuse to run a Japanese game).
         Survey about this: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2467547#pid2467547

FEATURE  New command SHOW_ALL_ROMS to render all ROMs in all launchers. Will be used by skins.

FEATURE  Supend/resume Kodi audio engine at launching. This will prevent sound problems in Linux. 
         Include a setting for this in addons "Settings" --> "Advanced".

FEATURE  Export/Import assets/artwork in ROM Collections. Encode binary files in base64 and put
         in an auxiliar JSON files. Exporting assets should be optional, not mandatory.

FEATURE  All requests are cached in TheGamesDB scraper.

FEATURE  All requests are cached in GameFAQs scraper.

FEATURE  All requests are cached in MobyGames scraper.

FEATURE  Resolve image URL for online asset scrapers. This will increase scraping speed a lot.
         Requires a change in the scraping API.

FEATURE  TheGamesDB scraper now returns Titles and Snaps. However, since there is no difference
         between Titles, Snaps and shots in TheGamesDB this only is useful when doing manual
         scraping.

FEATURE  Improve message reporting in Kodi GUI when scanning ROMs.

FEATURE  Improve launcher report and include is a No-Intro audit information.

FEATURE  Remove ROM tags (for example, (Europe), [Rev A]) from parent ROM names when showing 
         parent ROMs in a PClone launcher.

FEATURE  New No-Intro status 'Added'.

FEATURE  Browse by Category Virtual Launcher.
         http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826&pid=2458080#pid2458080

FEATURE  New platform "Microsoft Windows"

FEATURE  Add genre, plot and rating to ROM collections. Unify ROM Collections and Cateogories
         metadata. During the migration current collections names will be lost and user has
         to edit every ROM Collection and set a new name.

FEATURE  Request monospaced font on text viewer dialog (window 10147).

FIX      Fixed searches in launchers.
