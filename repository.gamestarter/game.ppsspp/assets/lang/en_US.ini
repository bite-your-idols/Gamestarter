# Thanks for your interest in translating PPSSPP.
#
# Simply copy this file to a new ini file with your language code,
# or use it to update an existing file with that name.
#
# To see a list of codes, view this page:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3191664/list-of-all-locales-and-their-short-codes
#
# Please note, while translating:
#
# Hash/sharp symbols (#) in this file indicate a comment. Lines that begin without one are
# considered to be a part of the actual translations.
#
# The left side of the equals sign indicates "key" values that PPSSPP uses to identify a string.
# If they don't match correctly, PPSSPP won't use them.
#
# Ampersands (&) on the RIGHT side of an equals sign denote an underlined keyboard hotkey.
# The hotkeys are only supported currently in the DesktopUI section, however.
#
# Example 1: &File. This will make it so when you press ALT + F on Windows, it'll open the File menu.
# Example 2: Homebrew && Demos. This would show one real ampersand in the menu.
#
# Happy translating.
