NeoActive Theme for RetroArch & Lakka
====================

About NeoActive
-----------------

Building on the work from the RetroActive theme, NeoActive applies a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum.  It is meant to blend the strengths of the Monochrome and RetroActive themes.

Source files for development of this theme can be found at https://github.com/baxysquare/baxy-retroarch-themes


Guidelines
----------

### Palette

 * Icons use grayscale gradient set from 20% gray to white.  Gradients are angled at alternating 135 and -45 degree angles to simulate shadows.  To add maximum contrast, white highlights and 40% gray shadows are applied to optimize recognition.
 * Unlike RetroActive icons, NeoActive icons do not have a border.
 * Translucency is discouraged. 

### Layout

 * The design should be easily recognizable.
 * The icons should be set to a 256x256 canvas and should be centered on a 64x64 grid. Snap design elements to the grid wherever possible to provide maximum clarity and scalability.
 * The maximum icon size is 232x232 centered on the canvas.
 
### Style

 * The level of detail is expanded beyond the scope of the monochrome theme, but favors gradients instead of a flat design.

### Export
 * The original source files were created with Adobe Illustrator and saved as PDF files. The SVG and PNG files can be created using the ImageMagick Mogrify command.
